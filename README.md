# Hugunica
This is the Hugo theme that I might use in my personal site(s). You're not the
target audience, so it's not going to be designed around you.

## Installation
```sh
hugo new site my_site
cd my_site
git submodule add https://github.com/michaelskyba/hugunica themes/hugunica
echo "theme = \"hugunica\"" >> config.toml
```
