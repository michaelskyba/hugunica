# Hugunica
This is the Hugo theme that I might use in my personal site(s). Other users
aren't the target audience, so it's unlikely that it will end up fitting your
needs.

## Installation
```sh
hugo new site my_site
cd my_site
git submodule add https://github.com/michaelskyba/hugunica themes/hugunica
echo "theme = \"hugunica\"" >> config.toml
```
